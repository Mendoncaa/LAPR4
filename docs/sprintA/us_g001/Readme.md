# US G001

## 1. Context

As Project Manager, I want the team to follow the technical constraints and concerns of the project.

## 2. Description

This user story pertains to the project manager's desire for the development team to adhere to the technical constraints and concerns outlined for the project. These constraints include the mandatory use of Java as the primary programming language, comprehensive technical documentation in the project repository, and the adoption of test-driven development practices. Furthermore, version control using a GitHub repository, continuous integration, and deployment scripts are essential aspects to be followed. Database configuration, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and adherence to specific technical requirements for various functionalities are also crucial elements to be considered.

## 3. Requirements

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The solution should be implemented using Java as the main language. Other languages can be used in accordance with more specific requirements.

- Project documentation should be always available on the project repository ("docs" folder, markdown format) and, when applicable, in accordance with the UML notation. The development process of every US (e.g.: analysis, design, testing, etc.) must be reported (as part of the documentation).

- The team should develop a relevant set of automated tests for every US / Class / Method. The team should aim to adopt a test-driven development approach.

- The source code of the solution as well as all the documentation and related artifacts should be versioned in a GitHub repository to be provided to the students. Only the main (master/main) branch will be used (e.g., as a source for releases).

- The GitHub repository will provide night builds with publishing of results and metrics.

- The repository should include the necessary scripts to build and deploy the solution in a variety of systems (at least Linux and Windows). It should also include a readme.md file in the root folder explaining how to build, deploy and execute the solution.

## 4. Team Reunion

We have arranged a meeting to discuss the affairs of this US. During a team reunion, all members agreed to follow the technical constraints and concerns outlined for the project.

## 5. Notes

- It's essential for the development team to closely follow the technical constraints and concerns outlined in order to ensure the successful implementation of the project.
