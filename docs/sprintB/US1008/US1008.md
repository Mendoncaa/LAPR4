# US1008 - As Language Engineer, I want to create interview models and job requirements

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Language Engineer, I want to develop interview models and job requirements that can be dynamically loaded as plugins into the system, allowing for flexible and configurable recruitment processes.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Question**: How does the Language Engineer create interview models and job requirements? Is it through text, or does he select questions for the interview and requirements for the job opening?
- **Answer**: The Language Engineer develops these as Java jar modules using grammar/language development techniques like ANTLR. These jars are then registered in the application with a unique name in a configuration file.

- **Question**: Are the identifiers for the interview modules and requirements automatic or manual?
- **Answer**: Each module is manually registered in the system with a unique name and a file path that points to the jar implementing the module.

- **Question**: What type of information is expected to be presented in the interview models and requirement specifications?
- **Answer**: The system should support a variety of question types as specified on page 8 of the documentation. Demonstrations should include at least two plugins of each type to showcase the system's support for multiple plugins.

- **Question**: How is the deployment of the jar file handled? Is it stored in the database or referenced by a path?
- **Answer**: The jar files are not stored in the database but are considered as part of the application code, managed in a source code repository. The application loads these dynamically, allowing additional functionality without generating a new version of the application.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- Successful creation and registration of Java jar modules for interview models and job requirements.
- The system must dynamically load these jars and allow configuration via a unique identifier linked to each jar.
- Demonstrations must include multiple plugins and support for the variety of question types outlined in the documentation.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- **US1008**, **US1009**, **US1011**: Dependency on the registration and selection of these plugins for job openings and interviews.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input**: Java jar files containing the interview models and job requirements, names and identifiers for registering these plugins.
- **Output**: Confirmation of successful registration and loading of plugins into the system.

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

- Diagram to depict the interactions for creating and registering interview models and job requirements, showing the flow between the system and the Language Engineer.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- Future enhancements might include the ability to update or modify these plugins directly through the system interface to adapt to changing recruitment needs.
