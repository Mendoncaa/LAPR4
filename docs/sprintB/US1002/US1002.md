# Rationale for Job Opening Creation Process

The following table outlines the responsibilities of each class involved in the job opening creation process, based on the final sequence diagram provided.

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer | Justification (with patterns) |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Step 1**: CustomManager initiates job opening creation | ... interacting with the actor? | `CreateJobOpeningUI` | **Pure Fabrication**: Manages user interaction and is not part of the domain model. |
|  | ... coordinating the use case? | `CreateJobOpeningController` | **Controller**: Coordinates the process of job opening creation based on user input. |
| **Step 2**: Validate and gather job opening details | ... handling user input validation and formatting? | `CreateJobOpeningUI` | **Pure Fabrication**: Handles data input and ensures that it conforms to expected formats. |
|  | ... processing the job opening creation request? | `CreateJobOpeningController` | **Controller**: Processes the input data and commands other systems to act upon this data. |
| **Step 3**: Job opening is created and saved | ... creating the job opening object? | `JobOpening` | **Creator**: Responsible for constructing the job opening entity with the provided parameters. |
|  | ... verifying customer existence? | `CustomerRepository` | **Information Expert**: Directly accesses the data storage to fetch customer details. |
|  | ... determining the next job number? | `JobOpeningRepository` | **Information Expert**: Manages the retrieval of job-related data, including generating the next job number. |
| **Step 4**: Confirmation is displayed to the CustomManager | ... saving the new job opening? | `JobOpeningRepository` | **Information Expert**: Responsible for managing persistence, such as saving job openings. |
|  | ... informing operation success? | `CreateJobOpeningUI` | **Pure Fabrication**: Responsible for showing success or failure messages to the user. |

This rationale provides a clear view of the roles and responsibilities of each class in the job opening creation process, aligning with the sequence diagram interactions.
