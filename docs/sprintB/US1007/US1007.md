# US1007 - As Customer Manager, I want to set up recruitment phases for a job opening

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to set up various recruitment phases for a job opening to organize and manage the recruitment process effectively.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Question**: Is a recruitment process required to validate a job opening?
- **Answer**: The recruitment process, including the setup of different phases, is considered an integral part of a job opening, but specific processes like interview assessments are assumed to be automatically configured as per company policy.

- **Question**: In setting up a job opening, is it necessary to directly link the setup phases with the selection of an interview model?
- **Answer**: While the setup of recruitment phases and the selection of an interview model are related, they can be considered separate functionalities. The recruitment process is valid with predefined interview assessment processes.

- **Question**: What is expected in the setup of a recruitment process?
- **Answer**: The setup involves defining dates for each phase and deciding whether to include an interview phase, which is optional.

- **Question**: Is it imperative to select job requirements and/or recruitment phases when registering a job opening?
- **Answer**: These can be executed at different times; however, the system should always maintain a consistent state.

- **Question**: Can phases of the recruitment process end and start on the same day?
- **Answer**: Phases can end and start on the same day, provided there is no overlap, such as one ending in the morning and another starting in the afternoon.

- **Question**: How does a Customer Manager choose a job opening to set up its phases?
- **Answer**: The Customer Manager selects from job openings they are responsible for managing.

- **Question**: Should a Customer Manager be able to set up all job openings in the system or just those they have registered?
- **Answer**: The Customer Manager should only set up job openings they are managing.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- The system allows the Customer Manager to define and adjust dates for each recruitment phase for a job opening.
- The system provides the ability to include or exclude an interview phase as part of the recruitment setup.
- All changes in the recruitment setup must keep the system in a consistent state.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- **US1002** and **US1009**: Dependencies on registering a job opening and selecting requirements specifications which may need to align with the setup of recruitment phases.
- **US1011**: Interaction with the interview model selection process.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input**: Selection of a job opening, dates for each recruitment phase, decision on including an interview phase.
