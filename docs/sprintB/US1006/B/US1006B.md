# US1006B - As Customer Manager, I want to view candidate details

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to view details of candidates to effectively manage recruitment processes and assess candidate qualifications and application statuses.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Question**: What candidate information should be displayed?
- **Answer**: The candidate's name as received in the application should be displayed along with all personal information registered in the system.

- **Question**: Will a Customer Manager have access to personal data of all candidates in the system or only those who submitted an application for a job opening managed by them?
- **Answer**: Currently, it is assumed that the Customer Manager can access personal data of any candidate.

- **Question**: Regarding the process of selecting a candidate and showing their personal information, would it make sense to allow the user to choose whether to list all candidates or to narrow down the list by selecting a job opening?
- **Answer**: While the system should apply best UI/UX practices, it is expected that the Customer Manager might want to filter the candidate list by specific job openings.

- **Question**: What type of information related to a candidate's applications is expected to be presented to the Customer Manager?
- **Answer**: Information listed should include the candidate's applications, indicating the job opening, date of application registration, the status of the application, and its identifier.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- The system must display the full name of the candidate as submitted in their application.
- The system should provide access to all registered personal information of the candidate.
- The system should allow the Customer Manager to view detailed application information related to each candidate.
- The system should enable filtering candidates based on job openings they have applied for.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- **US1005**: Integration with listing applications for specific job openings, as data shown for candidates might depend on applications listed through this user story.
- **US2002**: Relates to the import and automatic registration of candidates through the Application File Bot, which could influence the availability of candidate information in the system.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input**: Candidate selection criteria (e.g., by job opening, candidate ID).
- **Output**: Detailed information about the candidate, including name, application details (job opening, application date, status, ID).
