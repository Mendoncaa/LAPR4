- **Answer**: For each application, the candidate's identity and the state of their application should be displayed.

- **Question**: Should the list contain applications that have not yet completed the entire selection process defined in the setup of the Job Opening? If so, should the list contain the state/phase of each application?
- **Answer**: Yes, the list should include the state of the application to help the Customer Manager understand which applications have been rejected or are still in process.
