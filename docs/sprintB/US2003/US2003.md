# US2003 - As Operator, I want to generate a template file for verifying candidate requirements

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an Operator, I need to generate a template file that will be used to collect specific data required to verify the requirements of a job opening for a candidate.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Question**: Is it the Operator who registers an application or is it done automatically by the system?
- **Answer**: The Operator initiates the process, but the system automatically imports data from the Application File Bot. The template for verifying candidate requirements is generated by the Operator as part of this process.

- **Question**: What information needs to be extracted from the candidate to verify the requirements of a job opening?
- **Answer**: The information required is determined by the Requirements Specification model designed for the job opening.

- **Question**: How is the screening data managed after the applications are filtered?
- **Answer**: The Operator downloads and fills out the template file with required data. The Customer Manager then conducts the verification process using this information.

- **Question**: How is the usage of ANTLR directed in US2003?
- **Answer**: ANTLR can be used to generate the template text file, although it might be hardcoded in the plugin without needing a complex generation process. The template file is uploaded to the system for further processing.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- A template file is successfully generated using the specified criteria from the Requirements Specification.
- The template allows for the accurate collection and input of data necessary to verify candidate eligibility for the job opening.
- The system must handle the upload of the filled-out template file for further verification processes.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- **US2002**: Relies on the import of data from the Application File Bot.
- **US2004**: The completed template file is uploaded in US2004 for further processing.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input**: Requirement specifications from US2002.
- **Output**: A template file that is used to collect verification data from the Operator.

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

- Diagram to depict the interactions for generating and using the template file for candidate requirement verification, showing the flow between the system and the Operator.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- Future enhancements might include automating more aspects of the template generation process to reduce manual input and potential errors.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

- Classes such as `TemplateGenerator`, `RequirementSpecification`, `Operator`, and `ApplicationFile`.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

- Consideration for integrating more advanced text generation technologies to streamline the process.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1         | Generating the template file? | TemplateGenerator | Manages the creation of template files based on requirement specifications to ensure accuracy and compliance with job requirements. |

### 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

- Visual representation of the sequence of interactions for generating a template file.

### 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

- Shows classes like `TemplateGenerator`, `RequirementSpecification`, and their relationships.

## 4. Tests 

- Detail unit tests for validating the functionality of the template file generation and its compliance with the specified requirements.

## 5. Construction (Implementation)

- Discuss the implementation phase, any challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

## 6. Integration and Demo 

- Description of integration efforts and demonstration outcomes.

## 7. Observations

- Reflections on the process, potential improvements, and considerations for future enhancements.
