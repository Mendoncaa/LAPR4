# US1003 - As Customer Manager, I want to list job openings

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to list job openings to efficiently manage and review the recruitment processes associated with my responsibilities.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Question**: Is there a criterion for defining which job openings to list? Are we listing all openings in the system?
- **Answer**: It would be useful to filter job openings by customer and date. It's also practical to filter by active job openings as well as potentially listing all job openings.

- **Question**: How will the Customer Manager filter job openings by customer, and what about the date?
- **Answer**: The Customer Manager can filter job openings by customer using the customer's name or customer code. As for the date filter, it might be logical to allow searching for job openings by specific dates or within a date range.

- **Question**: When does a job opening become active? Is it when it's created with a set of requirements or when linked to an ongoing recruitment process?
- **Answer**: A job opening is considered active as long as its recruitment process has not concluded.

- **Question**: Can a Customer Manager list all job openings or only those assigned to them?
- **Answer**: It makes sense for a Customer Manager to only list job openings that are assigned to them.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- The system provides functionality to filter job openings by customer name or code.

- Job openings are listed with their current status, distinguishing between active and inactive states based on the recruitment process.
