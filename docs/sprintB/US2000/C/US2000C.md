| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...              | Answer                   | Justification (with patterns)                                                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1          | Requests to list all candidates                         | ListCandidatesUI         | The UI receives the request from the Operator to list all candidates.                                       |
| Step 2          | Forwards the request to the controller                    | ListCandidatesUI         | The UI sends the request to the controller for processing.                                                  |
| Step 3          | Verifies authorization                                     | ListCandidatesController | The Controller checks if the user is authorized by calling AuthorizationService with required roles.      |
| Step 4          | Authorization confirmed                                    | AuthorizationService    | The AuthorizationService confirms that the user has the appropriate roles (ADMIN, CUSTOMER_MANAGER, OPERATOR). |
| Step 5          | Retrieves candidates from the repository                   | ListCandidatesController | The Controller sends a request to the CandidateRepository to retrieve all candidates.                      |
| Step 6          | Candidate data returned                                     | CandidateRepository     | The CandidateRepository returns a list of all candidates to the controller.                                 |
| Step 7          | Sends list of candidates to UI                              | ListCandidatesController | The Controller forwards the list of candidates to the UI for display.                                       |
| Step 8          | Displays list of candidates or "No data"                     | ListCandidatesUI         | The UI displays the list of candidates or a message if no data is available.                                 |
