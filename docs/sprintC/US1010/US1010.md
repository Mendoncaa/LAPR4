# US1010 - Open or Close Job Opening Phases

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to open or close phases of the process for a job opening.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
  - The system must allow the Customer Manager to open or close specific phases of the recruitment process for a job opening.
  - Phases should follow the defined sequence without overlap; when one phase closes, the next one opens automatically.
  - The dates for each phase are indicative, and the Customer Manager should be able to activate a phase even if it is not within the predefined date range.
  - The phases must follow a strict sequence, and it is not possible to proceed to the next phase without closing the current phase, even if the dates for the current phase have not been met. 
  - The phases in the recruitment process are strictly sequential and must follow the defined order without overlaps.
  - Reversing to a previous phase is allowed under conditions where no specific activities of the current phase have started.

- **Clarifications**:
  - Opening or closing a phase means changing its status to active or inactive.
  - The phases are sequential: Application, Screening, Interviews (optional), Analysis, Result.
  - The Customer Manager is responsible for managing all phases of the process. Responsibilities include setting phase dates, managing transitions, and updating phase status in the system.
  - The interview phase is optional and its inclusion is determined by the Customer Manager during the setup of the recruitment process.
  - When a phase is closed, the system should automatically transition to the next phase regardless of the dates.

### Recruitment Process Phases

| Phase        | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application  | Candidates submit their applications.                                                                            |
| Screening    | Applications are verified against a set of requirements. Applications not meeting the requirements are rejected. |
| Interviews   | (Optional) Accepted candidates may be interviewed. Results are recorded for further analysis.                    |
| Analysis     | Applications are analyzed using all available information. Candidates are ranked based on this analysis.         |
| Result       | Candidates and customers are notified of the final results.                                                      |

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
  - The Customer Manager can successfully change the status of a phase to open or close.
  - The system should automatically transition to the next phase when the current phase is closed.
  - The Customer Manager should be able to open a phase even if the dates for that phase have not been met.
  - The phases must be managed within the recruitment process defined for each job opening.
  - The system should prevent phase overlaps and ensure that the phases are managed sequentially.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
  - The job opening and its recruitment process must be registered in the system.
  - The phase transition logic must be implemented in accordance with the defined recruitment process.
  - The system should allow the Customer Manager to skip the interview phase if it is not included in the recruitment process for a specific job opening.
  - Support registration and verification of applications for phase validation.
  - Support ranking of candidates during the Analysis phase.
  - Support notification to inform candidates and customers of the final results.
  - Ensure database support for persisting changes and retrieving job opening and phase data.
  - Ensure user authentication and authorization to allow only the Customer Manager to manage phase transitions.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
  - Job Reference
  - Desired action (open or close a specific phase, move to the next phase, or return to the previous phase)

- **Output Data**:
  - Options of phase transitions available for the selected job opening
  - Confirmation or error of the phase status change

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

![US010-SSD](01.requirements-engineering/svg/SSD.svg)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the interaction between the Customer Manager and the system when opening or closing a phase.
- The sequence should start with the Customer Manager's request and end with the system's confirmation or error of the phase status change.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- **Remarks**:
  - Ensure that phase transitions do not disrupt any ongoing candidate applications activity.
  - The Customer Manager should be able to manage the recruitment process phases efficiently and intuitively.
  - The system should ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the phase transitions.
  - The system should provide clear and concise messages to the Customer Manager to indicate the success or failure of the phase status change.
  - The phases must be managed sequentially, and transitioning to the next phase must occur automatically when the current phase is closed.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

![US010-DM](02.analysis/svg/DM.svg)

#### Description
- The domain model illustrates the `JobOpening` aggregate and its relationships with phases of the recruitment process, job applications, and ranks.
- Each `JobOpening` consists of a `JobReference` and a `RecruitmentProcess`.
- `JobReference` is identified by a `customerCode` and a `jobNumber`, uniquely identifying each job opening.
- The `RecruitmentProcess` tracks the status of the overall process and consists of multiple phases. It has a status which can be `Uninitiated`, `In Process`, or `Finished`, reflecting the progression of the job opening phases.
- Each `Phase` within the `RecruitmentProcess` is defined by its name (`PhaseName`), start date (`StartDate`), end date (`EndDate`), and status (`PhaseStatus`), which can be `Open` or `Closed`.
- Phases must follow a strict sequential order as defined in the recruitment process.
- `JobApplications` are associated with `JobOpenings` and include evaluations based on requirements and interviews. Each `JobApplication` can have a `RequirementsEvaluation` status (`Pending`, `Accepted`, or `Rejected`) and details of the interview process, including `InterviewGrade`.
- The `Rank` aggregate is associated with a `JobOpening` and has a unique identifier and a status (`Started` or `Finished`). Ranks are assigned to job openings and are evaluated by candidates.

**Domain Model Changes**:
- The introduction of `RecruitmentProcessStatus` provides a clear differentiation between the various states of the recruitment process, ensuring that it accurately reflects whether all phases are `Closed` and the process is `Finished`, or if the process is still `Uninitiated` or `In Process`.
- The explicit association between `JobOpening` and `Rank` indicates that each job opening has a rank associated.
- The implementation of `RankStatus` captures the status of the ranking process, indicating whether it has `Started` or `Finished`, providing a clear view of the ranking progression for each job opening.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

- **Remarks**:
    - Ensure that phase objects within a `JobOpening` are manipulated correctly to reflect their status transitions.
    - Any changes to the phases should be immediately reflected in the system's state and visible to relevant actors (Customer Manager and potentially Admin).
    - Ensure that the phase transitions are managed without overlaps. Each phase must be closed before the next one can be opened.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer                  | Justification (with patterns)                                                                  |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1         | User inserts JobReference as asked          | `PhasesUI`              | The UI component collects the job reference input from the user.                               |
| Step 2         | Submitting JobReference for validation      | `PhasesController`      | The controller coordinates the job reference validation request to the `JobOpeningRepository`. |
| Step 3         | Validating if JobReference exists           | `JobOpeningRepository`  | Validates if the provided job reference corresponds to an existing job opening.                |
| Step 4         | JobReference validation result              | `PhasesController`      | Receives the validation result from the `JobOpeningRepository`.                                |
| Step 5         | Checking phase transition validity          | `PhaseValidatorService` | Validates if the current phase of the job opening can go forward, backward, both, or neither.  |
| Step 6         | User selects the desired action             | `PhasesUI`              | The UI component allows the user to select the desired phase transition action.                |
| Step 7         | Updating the phase status                   | `PhasesController`      | The controller coordinates the update request to the `RecruitmentProcess` domain model.        |
| Step 8         | Changing phase status                       | `RecruitmentProcess`    | The domain model updates the status of the phases as per the user's request.                   |
| Step 9         | Saving the changes                          | `JobOpeningRepository`  | Persists the changes in the database.                                                          |
| Step 10        | Displaying confirmation or error message    | `PhasesUI`              | Prints confirmation or error message in the UI.                                                |

#### Phase Validation Logic

The `PhaseValidatorService` validates the phase transition options for each phase as follows:

- **Application Phase**:
    - Can move forward if there is at least one application.
    - Can't move backwards as it is the first phase and Applications are already being submitted. [Reference](/Users/1diogonunes/IdeaProjects/ISEP/LAPR4/sem4pi-23-24-2dj4/docs/sprintC/US1010/Q&A.md)
    - **Dependencies**: Interacts with `ApplicationRepository` to count applications.
  
- **Screening Phase**:
    - Can move backward if no applications have been verified.
    - Can move forward if all applications have been verified.
    - **Dependencies**: Interacts with `ApplicationRepository` to check if applications are verified against requirements.

- **Interviews Phase** (if included):
    - Can move backward if no interviews have been conducted.
    - Can move forward if all scheduled interviews are completed.
    - **Dependencies**: Interacts with `ApplicationRepository` to check interview statuses.

- **Analysis Phase**:
    - Can move backward if the candidates have not been ranked.
    - Can move forward if candidates have been ranked.
    - **Dependencies**: Interacts with `RankRepository` to check if candidates have been ranked.

- **Result Phase**:
    - Can move backward if no results have been published.
    - Can close the phase if results have been published.
    - **Dependencies**: Checks if results have been published within the `ApplicationRepository`.

#### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- `RecruitmentProcess`: The domain model class that represents the job opening and its phases, responsible for updating phase statuses.

Other software classes (i.e., Pure Fabrication) identified:

- `PhasesUI`: The user interface component that allows the Customer Manager to interact with the job opening phases.
- `PhasesController`: Coordinates the interaction between the UI, domain model, and other services.
- `JobOpeningRepository`: Validates the job reference and persists the changes to the job opening in the database.
- `PhasesController`: Handles the initial request for opening or closing a phase and coordinates the process.
- `PhaseValidatorService`: Validates the phase transition to ensure it complies with business rules (e.g., no overlaps, proper sequence).

### Sequence of Interactions

1. **CustomerManager** initiates the process by interacting with `PhasesUI` through `doShow()`.
2. **PhasesUI** creates an instance of `PhasesController`.
3. **PhasesController** requests `JobOpeningRepository` from `PersistenceContext`.
4. **PersistenceContext** provides `JobOpeningRepository` to `PhasesController`.
5. **PhasesController** returns the instance to `PhasesUI`.
6. **PhasesUI** prompts the **CustomerManager** to input a `JobReference`.
7. **CustomerManager** provides the `JobReference` to `PhasesUI`.
8. **PhasesUI** calls `validateJobReference()` on `PhasesController` with the provided `JobReference`.
9. **PhasesController** queries `JobOpeningRepository` to find the job opening associated with the `JobReference`.
10. **JobOpeningRepository** returns the corresponding `JobOpening` to `PhasesController`.

18. **PhaseValidatorService** checks if the current phase is "Analysis":
  - If yes, it queries `RankRepository` to find the rank associated with the `JobReference`.
  - If no, it queries `ApplicationRepository` to find the applications associated with the `JobReference`.
19. **RankRepository** or **ApplicationRepository** returns the corresponding data to `PhaseValidatorService`.
20. **PhaseValidatorService** counts applications for specific phases:
  - If the current phase is "Screening", it counts screening applications.
  - If the current phase is "Interviews", it counts interview applications.
  - If the current phase is "Result", it counts result applications.
21. **PhaseValidatorService** validates the phase transition forward and backward.
22. **PhaseValidatorService** returns the validation options to `PhasesController`.
23. **PhasesController** returns the validation options to `PhasesUI`.
24. **PhasesUI** presents the options to **CustomerManager**.
25. **CustomerManager** selects an option and provides it to `PhasesUI`.
26. **PhasesUI** calls `ProcessTransition()` on `PhasesController` with the chosen option.
27. Depending on the chosen option, `PhasesController` calls either `nextPhase()` or `previousPhase()` on `RecruitmentProcess`.
28. **PhasesController** calls `AuthorizationService` to ensure the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions.
29. **PhasesController** saves the updated `RecruitmentProcess` using `JobOpeningRepository`.
30. **PhasesController** returns a confirmation or error message to `PhasesUI`.

**Description:** Verify that the transition from the Application phase to the Screening phase is valid if there is at least one application.

	@Test
    public void validateForwardTransitionFromApplicationPhase() {
        // Verify that the transition from the Application phase to the Screening phase is valid if there is at least one application.
        boolean result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionForward(PhaseName.APPLICATION, 1, 0);
        assertTrue(result);

        // Check if the transition is valid when there are multiple applications.
        result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionForward(PhaseName.APPLICATION, 5, 0);
        assertTrue(result);

        // Check if the transition is invalid when there are no applications.
        result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionForward(PhaseName.APPLICATION, 0, 0);
        assertFalse(result);
    }

        boolean result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionForward(PhaseName.APPLICATION, 0, 0);
        assertFalse(result);

        // Check if the transition is invalid for other phases when there are no applications.
        for (PhaseName phaseName : PhaseName.values()) {
            if (phaseName != PhaseName.APPLICATION) {
                result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionForward(phaseName, 0, 0);
                assertFalse(result);
            }
        }
    }

### 2. `RecruitmentProcess` Tests

**Description:** Verify that calling `nextPhase()` correctly advances the process from the current phase to the next phase in the sequence.

	@Test
    public void transitionFromResultToFinished() {
        recruitmentProcess.addPhase(new Phase(PhaseName.APPLICATION));
        recruitmentProcess.addPhase(new Phase(PhaseName.SCREENING));

        // Add phases to the recruitment process
        recruitmentProcess.addPhase(new Phase(PhaseName.APPLICATION));
        recruitmentProcess.addPhase(new Phase(PhaseName.SCREENING));

        // Initially, the status of the APPLICATION phase should be CLOSED
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.CLOSED, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(0).getPhaseStatus());

        // Call nextPhase() to move to the APPLICATION phase
        recruitmentProcess.nextPhase();

        // Now, the status of the APPLICATION phase should be OPEN
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.OPEN, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(0).getPhaseStatus());

        // Call nextPhase() to move to the SCREENING phase
        recruitmentProcess.nextPhase();

        // The status of the APPLICATION phase should now be CLOSED
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.CLOSED, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(0).getPhaseStatus());

        // And the status of the SCREENING phase should be OPEN
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.OPEN, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(1).getPhaseStatus());

        // Call previousPhase() to move back to the APPLICATION phase
        recruitmentProcess.previousPhase();

        // The status of the APPLICATION phase should now be OPEN again
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.OPEN, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(0).getPhaseStatus());

        // And the status of the SCREENING phase should be CLOSED
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.CLOSED, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(1).getPhaseStatus());
    }

### 3. `PhasesController` Tests
#### Test: Validate Job Reference
**Description:** Verify that the job reference provided by the Customer Manager is correctly validated.

#### Test: Handle Valid Phase Transition Request
**Description:** Ensure that the controller handles a valid phase transition request appropriately and updates the phase status.

> **Note:** The `PhasesController` Tests were not implemented due to the complexity of the interactions and dependencies involved. The functionality was tested through Functional Tests.

## Functional Tests

### 1. Invalid Transition Attempt
**Description:** As a Customer Manager, I want to receive an error when attempting to transition from a phase that has not been completed.

**Steps:**
1. Insert a valid Job Reference.
2. Attempt to close a phase that has not met its completion criteria.
3. Confirm that an error message is displayed and the phase remains open.

### 2. Validate Full Recruitment Process
**Description:** As a Customer Manager, I want to successfully manage the finished recruitment process from Application to Result.

**Steps:**
1. Insert a valid Job Reference.
2. Open the Application phase and proceed through each phase sequentially, ensuring each transition is validated.
3. Confirm that the Result phase is reached and the recruitment process status is updated to Finished.
