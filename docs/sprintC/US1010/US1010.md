# US1010 - Open or Close Job Opening Phases

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to open or close phases of the process for a job opening.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
    - The system must allow the Customer Manager to open or close specific phases of the recruitment process for a job opening.
    - Phases should follow the defined sequence without overlap; when one phase closes, the next one opens automatically.
    - The dates for each phase are indicative, and the Customer Manager should be able to activate a phase even if it is not within the predefined date range.

- **Clarifications**:
    - Opening or closing a phase means changing its status to active or inactive.
    - The phases are sequential: Application, Screening, Interviews (optional), Analysis, Result.
    - The Customer Manager has the responsibility to manage the phases, including setting their dates and determining if interviews are included
  
### Recruitment Process Phases

| Phase        | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application  | Candidates submit their applications.                                                                            |
| Screening    | Applications are verified against a set of requirements. Applications not meeting the requirements are rejected. |
| Interviews   | (Optional) Accepted candidates may be interviewed. Results are recorded for further analysis.                    |
| Analysis     | Applications are analyzed using all available information. Candidates are ranked based on this analysis.         |
| Result       | Candidates and customers are notified of the final results.                                                      |

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
    - The Customer Manager can successfully change the status of a phase to open or close.
    - The system should automatically transition to the next phase when the current phase is closed.
    - The phases must be managed within the recruitment process defined for each job opening.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
    - The job opening and its recruitment process must be registered in the system.
    - The phase transition logic must be implemented in accordance with the defined recruitment process.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
    - Job Reference
    - Phase Name
    - Current status of the phase
    - Desired action (open/close)
    - Dates associated with the phases

- **Output Data**:
    - Confirmation of the phase status change
    - Updated recruitment process status

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

![US010-SSD](01.requirements-engineering/svg/SSD.svg)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the interaction between the Customer Manager and the system when opening or closing a phase.
- The sequence should start with the Customer Manager's request and end with the system's confirmation or error of the phase status change.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- **Remarks**:
    - Ensure that phase transitions do not disrupt any ongoing candidate evaluations.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

![US010-DM](02.analysis/svg/DM.svg)

**Description**:
- The domain model illustrates the `JobOpening` aggregate and its relationship with phases of the recruitment process.
- Each `JobOpening` can have multiple phases, but the phases must follow a strict sequence as defined in the recruitment process.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

- **Remarks**:
    - Ensure that phase objects within a `JobOpening` are manipulated correctly to reflect their status transitions.
    - Any changes to the phases should be immediately reflected in the system's state and visible to relevant actors (Customer Manager and potentially Admin).

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Class1
* Class2
* Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* xxxxUI
* xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view representing the sequence of interactions between software objects that allows to fulfill the requirements._

![USXXX-SD](03.design/svg/SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirements as well as their relations, attributes and methods._

![USXXX-CD](03.design/svg/CD.svg)


# 4. Tests
_In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling._

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

_In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits._

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._


# 6. Integration and Demo

_In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system._


# 7. Observations

_In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work._
