# US1010 - Open or Close Job Opening Phases

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to open or close phases of the process for a job opening.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
  - The system must allow the Customer Manager to open or close specific phases of the recruitment process for a job opening.
  - Phases should follow the defined sequence without overlap; when one phase closes, the next one opens automatically.
  - The dates for each phase are indicative, and the Customer Manager should be able to activate a phase even if it is not within the predefined date range.
  - The phases must follow a strict sequence, and it is not possible to proceed to the next phase without closing the current phase, even if the dates for the current phase have not been met. 
  - The phases in the recruitment process are strictly sequential and must follow the defined order without overlaps.
  - Reversing to a previous phase is allowed under conditions where no specific activities of the current phase have started.

- **Clarifications**:
  - Opening or closing a phase means changing its status to active or inactive.
  - The phases are sequential: Application, Screening, Interviews (optional), Analysis, Result.
  - The Customer Manager is responsible for managing all phases of the process. Responsibilities include setting phase dates, managing transitions, and updating phase status in the system.
  - The interview phase is optional and its inclusion is determined by the Customer Manager during the setup of the recruitment process.
  - When a phase is closed, the system should automatically transition to the next phase regardless of the dates.

### Recruitment Process Phases

| Phase        | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application  | Candidates submit their applications.                                                                            |
| Screening    | Applications are verified against a set of requirements. Applications not meeting the requirements are rejected. |
| Interviews   | (Optional) Accepted candidates may be interviewed. Results are recorded for further analysis.                    |
| Analysis     | Applications are analyzed using all available information. Candidates are ranked based on this analysis.         |
| Result       | Candidates and customers are notified of the final results.                                                      |

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
  - The Customer Manager can successfully change the status of a phase to open or close.
  - The system should automatically transition to the next phase when the current phase is closed.
  - The Customer Manager should be able to open a phase even if the dates for that phase have not been met.
  - The phases must be managed within the recruitment process defined for each job opening.
  - The system should prevent phase overlaps and ensure that the phases are managed sequentially.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
  - The job opening and its recruitment process must be registered in the system.
  - The phase transition logic must be implemented in accordance with the defined recruitment process.
  - The system should allow the Customer Manager to skip the interview phase if it is not included in the recruitment process for a specific job opening.
  - Support registration and verification of applications for phase validation.
  - Support ranking of candidates during the Analysis phase.
  - Support notification to inform candidates and customers of the final results.
  - Ensure database support for persisting changes and retrieving job opening and phase data.
  - Ensure user authentication and authorization to allow only the Customer Manager to manage phase transitions.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
  - Job Reference
  - Desired action (open or close a specific phase, move to the next phase, or return to the previous phase)

- **Output Data**:
  - Options of phase transitions available for the selected job opening
  - Confirmation or error of the phase status change

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

![US010-SSD](01.requirements-engineering/svg/SSD.svg)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the interaction between the Customer Manager and the system when opening or closing a phase.
- The sequence should start with the Customer Manager's request and end with the system's confirmation or error of the phase status change.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- **Remarks**:
  - Ensure that phase transitions do not disrupt any ongoing candidate applications activity.
  - The Customer Manager should be able to manage the recruitment process phases efficiently and intuitively.
  - The system should ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the phase transitions.
  - The system should provide clear and concise messages to the Customer Manager to indicate the success or failure of the phase status change.
  - The phases must be managed sequentially, and transitioning to the next phase must occur automatically when the current phase is closed.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

![US010-DM](02.analysis/svg/DM.svg)

#### Description
- The domain model illustrates the `JobOpening` aggregate and its relationship with phases of the recruitment process, job applications, and ranks.
- Each `JobOpening` can have multiple phases, and these phases must follow a strict sequential order as defined in the recruitment process.
- The `JobOpening` aggregate includes a `RecruitmentProcess`, which tracks the status of the overall process. The status can be uninitiated, in process, or finished, reflecting the overall progression of the job opening phases.
- Each `Phase` within the `RecruitmentProcess` is defined by its name, start date, end date, and status (open or closed).
- `JobApplications` are associated with `JobOpening` and include evaluations based on requirements and interviews. The model captures details of the interview process, including interview dates and grades, and indicates whether applications are accepted or rejected.
- Additionally, the model includes a `Rank` aggregate. Each `Rank` is associated with a `JobOpening` and has a unique identifier and value. Ranks are assigned to job openings and are evaluated by candidates.
- The `Rank` aggregate captures the ranking of candidates, which is crucial for phases that involve ranking assessments.

**Domain Model Changes**:
- The implementation of `RecruitmentProcessStatus` is necessary to accurately reflect the state of the recruitment process when all phases are `Closed`.
- This status is critical to distinguish between a recruitment process that hasn't been initialized and one that has finished. Without this differentiation, a closed phase could ambiguously indicate either an uninitiated or a concluded recruitment process.
- The inclusion of `RecruitmentProcessStatus` ensures clarity in the overall state of the recruitment process, providing a precise understanding of whether the recruitment is yet to start or has been completed.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

- **Remarks**:
    - Ensure that phase objects within a `JobOpening` are manipulated correctly to reflect their status transitions.
    - Any changes to the phases should be immediately reflected in the system's state and visible to relevant actors (Customer Manager and potentially Admin).
    - Ensure that the phase transitions are managed without overlaps. Each phase must be closed before the next one can be opened.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer                  | Justification (with patterns)                                                                  |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1         | User inserts JobReference as asked          | `PhasesUI`              | The UI component collects the job reference input from the user.                               |
| Step 2         | Submitting JobReference for validation      | `PhasesController`      | The controller coordinates the job reference validation request to the `JobOpeningRepository`. |
| Step 3         | Validating if JobReference exists           | `JobOpeningRepository`  | Validates if the provided job reference corresponds to an existing job opening.                |
| Step 4         | JobReference validation result              | `PhasesController`      | Receives the validation result from the `JobOpeningRepository`.                                |
| Step 5         | Checking phase transition validity          | `PhaseValidatorService` | Validates if the current phase of the job opening can go forward, backward, both, or neither.  |
| Step 6         | User selects the desired action             | `PhasesUI`              | The UI component allows the user to select the desired phase transition action.                |
| Step 7         | Updating the phase status                   | `PhasesController`      | The controller coordinates the update request to the `RecruitmentProcess` domain model.        |
| Step 8         | Changing phase status                       | `RecruitmentProcess`    | The domain model updates the status of the phases as per the user's request.                   |
| Step 9         | Saving the changes                          | `JobOpeningRepository`  | Persists the changes in the database.                                                          |
| Step 10        | Displaying confirmation or error message    | `PhasesUI`              | Prints confirmation or error message in the UI.                                                |

#### Phase Validation Logic

The `PhaseValidatorService` validates the phase transition options for each phase as follows:

- **Application Phase**:
    - Can move forward if there is at least one application.
    - Can't move backwards as it is the first phase and Applications are already being submitted. [Reference](/Users/1diogonunes/IdeaProjects/ISEP/LAPR4/sem4pi-23-24-2dj4/docs/sprintC/US1010/Q&A.md)
    - **Dependencies**: Interacts with `ApplicationRepository` to count applications.
  
- **Screening Phase**:
    - Can move backward if no applications have been verified.
    - Can move forward if all applications have been verified.
    - **Dependencies**: Interacts with `ApplicationRepository` to check if applications are verified against requirements.

- **Interviews Phase** (if included):
    - Can move backward if no interviews have been conducted.
    - Can move forward if all scheduled interviews are completed.
    - **Dependencies**: Interacts with `ApplicationRepository` to check interview statuses.

- **Analysis Phase**:
    - Can move backward if the candidates have not been ranked.
    - Can move forward if candidates have been ranked.
    - **Dependencies**: Interacts with `RankRepository` to check if candidates have been ranked.

- **Result Phase**:
    - Can move backward if no results have been published.
    - Can close the phase if results have been published.
    - **Dependencies**: Checks if results have been published within the `ApplicationRepository`.

#### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- `RecruitmentProcess`: The domain model class that represents the job opening and its phases, responsible for updating phase statuses.

Other software classes (i.e., Pure Fabrication) identified:

- `PhasesUI`: The user interface component that allows the Customer Manager to interact with the job opening phases.
- `PhasesController`: Coordinates the interaction between the UI, domain model, and other services.
- `JobOpeningRepository`: Validates the job reference and persists the changes to the job opening in the database.
- `PhasesController`: Handles the initial request for opening or closing a phase and coordinates the process.
- `PhaseValidatorService`: Validates the phase transition to ensure it complies with business rules (e.g., no overlaps, proper sequence).

**Description:** Verify that the transition from the Application phase to the Screening phase is valid if there is at least one application.

	@Test
    public void validateForwardTransitionFromApplicationPhase() {
        // Verify that the transition from the Application phase to the Screening phase is valid if there is at least one application.
        boolean result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionForward(PhaseName.APPLICATION, 1, 0);
        assertTrue(result);

        // Check if the transition is valid when there are multiple applications.
        result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionForward(PhaseName.APPLICATION, 5, 0);
        assertTrue(result);

        // Check if the transition is invalid when there are no applications.

**Description:** Ensure that moving back from the Screening phase to the Application phase is valid if no applications have been verified.

	@Test
    public void validateBackwardTransitionFromScreeningPhase() {
        // Ensure that moving back from the Screening phase to the Application phase is valid if no applications have been verified.
        boolean result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionBackward(PhaseName.SCREENING, 0);
        assertTrue(result);

        // Check if the transition is invalid when there are applications that been verified.
        result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionBackward(PhaseName.SCREENING, 5);
        assertFalse(result);
    }

#### Test: Validate Transition When No Applications
**Description:** Confirm that transitioning forward from the Application phase is invalid if there are no applications.

        // Confirm that transitioning forward from the Application phase is invalid if there are no applications.
        boolean result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionForward(PhaseName.APPLICATION, 0, 0);
        assertFalse(result);

        // Check if the transition is invalid for other phases when there are no applications.
        for (PhaseName phaseName : PhaseName.values()) {
            if (phaseName != PhaseName.APPLICATION) {
                result = PhaseValidatorService.validatePhaseTransitionForward(phaseName, 0, 0);
                assertFalse(result);
            }
        }
    }

### 2. `RecruitmentProcess` Tests
#### Test: Next Phase Transition
**Description:** Verify that calling `nextPhase()` correctly advances the process from the current phase to the next phase in the sequence.

	@Test
    public void transitionFromResultToFinished() {
        recruitmentProcess.addPhase(new Phase(PhaseName.APPLICATION));
        recruitmentProcess.addPhase(new Phase(PhaseName.SCREENING));

        recruitmentProcess.nextPhase(); // Move to SCREENING
        recruitmentProcess.nextPhase(); // Move to INTERVIEWS
        recruitmentProcess.nextPhase(); // Move to ANALYSIS
        recruitmentProcess.nextPhase(); // Move to RESULT
        boolean result = recruitmentProcess.nextPhase(); // Move to FINISHED
        assertTrue(result);
        assertEquals(RecruitmentProcessStatus.FINISHED, recruitmentProcess.getStatus());

        // Add phases to the recruitment process
        recruitmentProcess.addPhase(new Phase(PhaseName.APPLICATION));
        recruitmentProcess.addPhase(new Phase(PhaseName.SCREENING));

        // Initially, the status of the APPLICATION phase should be CLOSED
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.CLOSED, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(0).getPhaseStatus());

        // Call nextPhase() to move to the APPLICATION phase
        recruitmentProcess.nextPhase();

        // Now, the status of the APPLICATION phase should be OPEN
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.OPEN, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(0).getPhaseStatus());

        // Call nextPhase() to move to the SCREENING phase
        recruitmentProcess.nextPhase();

        // The status of the APPLICATION phase should now be CLOSED
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.CLOSED, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(0).getPhaseStatus());

        // And the status of the SCREENING phase should be OPEN
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.OPEN, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(1).getPhaseStatus());

        // Call previousPhase() to move back to the APPLICATION phase
        recruitmentProcess.previousPhase();

        // The status of the APPLICATION phase should now be OPEN again
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.OPEN, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(0).getPhaseStatus());

        // And the status of the SCREENING phase should be CLOSED
        assertEquals(PhaseStatus.CLOSED, recruitmentProcess.getPhases().get(1).getPhaseStatus());
    }
