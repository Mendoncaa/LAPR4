# US1017 - Upload Candidate Interview Answers


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to upload a text file with the candidate responses for an interview.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
    - The system must allow the Customer Manager to upload a text file with the candidate's responses for an interview.
    - The text file must be validated against the defined grammar to ensure it follows the expected format.
    - If the file format is invalid, the system must reject the upload and request a valid file from the user.
    - If the file is in the correct format, its content must be imported into the system for later use (e.g., in US1018).
    - The file must be stored securely, ideally integrated into the database, or, if not possible, in a secure server directory.

- **Clarifications**:
    - Validation errors, such as numeric answers filled with letters, should be considered format errors and lead to file rejection in US1017.
    - Syntax must be verified at the time of upload. If everything is correct, the file should be "imported" into the system for later use.
    - The imported file must be stored securely, preferably in the database, or in a secure server directory if the database is not feasible.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
    - The Customer Manager can upload a text file with the candidate's interview responses.
    - The system verifies the file format according to the defined grammar.
    - The system rejects files that are not in the correct format and provides feedback to the user.
    - The system imports the content of the valid file into the system for later use.
    - The imported file is stored securely, preferably in the database.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
    - The defined grammar to validate the file format.
    - The storage system for the imported files.
    - The file upload process must be available and functional.
    - The file import process must be integrated with the subsequent evaluation system (US1018).
    - Authentication and authorization support to ensure that only the Customer Manager can upload response files.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
    - Text file with the candidate's interview responses.

- **Output Data**:
    - Confirmation that the file was successfully uploaded and imported.
    - Error messages and feedback if the file is in an invalid format.

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the interaction between the Customer Manager and the system when uploading a candidate's interview answers file.
- The sequence should start with the Customer Manager's request and end with the system's confirmation or error of the file upload.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- **Remarks**:
    - Ensure the file format validation is robust to prevent errors during upload.
    - Ensure the file import is done securely and the data is stored appropriately for later use.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

#### Description
- The domain model illustrates the `JobOpening` aggregate and its relationship with the phases of the recruitment process, including the interview phase and candidate responses.
- Each `JobOpening` can have multiple phases, which follow a defined sequential order.
- The interview phase (`InterviewPhase`) is an extension of the phase (`Phase`) and includes specific interviews (`Interview`).
- Each `Interview` is associated with a `Candidate` and includes a list of `InterviewQuestions` and `InterviewAnswers`.
- The responses (`InterviewAnswer`) are associated with specific questions (`InterviewQuestion`) and include the candidate's response and the obtained score.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

- **Remarks**:
    - Ensure that the candidate responses are correctly stored and can be used for subsequent evaluation.
    - Ensure that phase status changes are immediately reflected in the system and visible to relevant actors (Customer Manager and potentially Admin).
    - Phase transitions must be managed without overlaps; each phase must be closed before the next can be opened.

This completes the documentation for US1017 based on the provided template and the requirements from the client.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

# 4. Tests
_In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling._

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

_In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits._

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._


# 6. Integration and Demo

_In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system._


# 7. Observations

_In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work._
