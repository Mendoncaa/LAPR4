# US1017 - Upload Candidate Interview Answers


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to upload a text file with the candidate responses for an interview.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
    - The system must allow the Customer Manager to upload a text file with the candidate's responses for an interview.
    - The text file must be validated against the defined grammar to ensure it follows the expected format.
    - If the file format is invalid, the system must reject the upload and request a valid file from the user.
    - If the file is in the correct format, its content must be imported into the system for later use (e.g., in US1018).
    - The file must be stored securely, ideally integrated into the database, or, if not possible, in a secure server directory.

- **Clarifications**:
    - Validation errors, such as numeric answers filled with letters, should be considered format errors and lead to file rejection in US1017.
    - Syntax must be verified at the time of upload. If everything is correct, the file should be "imported" into the system for later use.
    - The imported file must be stored securely, preferably in the database, or in a secure server directory if the database is not feasible.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
    - The Customer Manager can upload a text file with the candidate's interview responses.
    - The system verifies the file format according to the defined grammar.
    - The system rejects files that are not in the correct format and provides feedback to the user.
    - The system imports the content of the valid file into the system for later use.
    - The imported file is stored securely, preferably in the database.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
    - The defined grammar to validate the file format.
    - The storage system for the imported files.
    - The file upload process must be available and functional.
    - The file import process must be integrated with the subsequent evaluation system (US1018).
    - Authentication and authorization support to ensure that only the Customer Manager can upload response files.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
    - Text file with the candidate's interview responses.

- **Output Data**:
    - Confirmation that the file was successfully uploaded and imported.
    - Error messages and feedback if the file is in an invalid format.

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the interaction between the Customer Manager and the system when uploading a candidate's interview answers file.
- The sequence should start with the Customer Manager's request and end with the system's confirmation or error of the file upload.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- **Remarks**:
    - Ensure the file format validation is robust to prevent errors during upload.
    - Ensure the file import is done securely and the data is stored appropriately for later use.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

![US1017-DM](02.analysis/svg/DM.svg)

#### Description

- The domain model illustrates the `Application` aggregate and its relationship with `Candidate`, `JobOpening`, and `File`.
- Each `Application` can have multiple associated `Files`, which represent the candidate's requirements and interview answers.
- The `Application` aggregate includes an `ApplicationState`, which tracks the status of the application. The state can be `SUBMITTED`, `IN_REVIEW`, `ACCEPTED`, or `REJECTED`.
- The `File` entity includes attributes for the file path, file type (such as Candidate Requirements or Interview Answers), and its content.
- The `Candidate` aggregate represents the individual applying for the job and includes attributes such as email, name, and phone number.
- The `JobOpening` aggregate represents the job the candidate is applying for and includes details like job reference, number of vacancies, job title, contract type, and description.

**Domain Model Changes**:
- The `Application` entity is associated with `File` entities that hold the candidate's requirements and interview answers. These files are validated for syntax and stored for later evaluation.
- The `Validator` component ensures the uploaded files comply with the defined grammar and syntax.
- The `FileRepository` component handles the storage and retrieval of these files.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

- **Remarks**:
  - Ensure that the `Application` entity is correctly associated with the uploaded files and that these files are validated and stored efficiently.
  - The syntax validation is crucial to ensure that the files meet the defined grammar before they are accepted and stored in the system.
  - Any errors in the file syntax should be reported back to the operator for correction and re-upload.


## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer                                  | Justification (with patterns)                                                                  |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1         | Request to upload candidate requirements file | `UploadCandidateRequirementsUI`          | The UI component collects the request from the user.                                            |
| Step 2         | Requesting candidate requirements file       | `UploadCandidateRequirementsUI`          | The UI component asks the user to provide the candidate requirements file.                     |
| Step 3         | Providing the candidate requirements file    | `Operator`                               | The operator provides the file to the UI component.                                             |
| Step 4         | Uploading candidate requirements file        | `UploadCandidateRequirementsController`  | The controller coordinates the upload request to the service layer.                             |
| Step 5         | Validating syntax of the file                | `RequirementsEvaluator`                  | The service validates the syntax of the provided file using ANTLR.                              |
| Step 6         | Storing the file path                        | `CandidateRequirementsService`           | The service stores the file path after successful validation.                                   |
| Step 7         | Saving the file path                         | `ApplicationRepository`                  | The repository persists the file path in the database.                                          |
| Step 8         | Confirming the upload success                | `UploadCandidateRequirementsController`  | The controller receives the confirmation and informs the UI.                                    |
| Step 9         | Displaying confirmation to the user          | `UploadCandidateRequirementsUI`          | The UI component displays the success message to the operator.                                  |

#### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- `Application`: The domain model class that represents the candidate's application, including the requirements file.
- `File`: The value object representing the file, including its path and type.
- `Candidate`: The domain model class representing the candidate associated with the application.

Other software classes (i.e., Pure Fabrication) identified:

- `UploadCandidateRequirementsUI`: The user interface component that allows the Operator to upload candidate requirements files.
- `UploadCandidateRequirementsController`: Coordinates the interaction between the UI, domain model, and service layer.
- `CandidateRequirementsService`: Handles the storage of the file path after validation.
- `ApplicationRepository`: Persists the file path and associated application details in the database.
- `RequirementsEvaluator`: Validates the syntax of the provided file using ANTLR.

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view representing the sequence of interactions between software objects that allows to fulfill the requirements._

![USXXX-SD](03.design/svg/SD.svg)

#### Interaction Steps

1. **Request to Upload File**:
  - The `Operator` requests to upload a candidate requirements file using the `UploadCandidateRequirementsUI`.

2. **Request Candidate Requirements File**:
  - The `UploadCandidateRequirementsUI` requests the candidate requirements file from the `Operator`.

3. **Provide Candidate Requirements File**:
  - The `Operator` provides the candidate requirements file to the `UploadCandidateRequirementsUI`.

4. **Submit File Path**:
  - The `UploadCandidateRequirementsUI` submits the file path to the `UploadCandidateRequirementsController`.

5. **Validate File Syntax**:
  - The `UploadCandidateRequirementsController` sends the file to the `RequirementsEvaluator` to validate its syntax.

6. **Return Validation Result**:
  - The `RequirementsEvaluator` returns the validation result (valid or invalid) to the `UploadCandidateRequirementsController`.

7. **Store File Path**:
  - If the file is valid, the `UploadCandidateRequirementsController` sends a request to store the file path to the `CandidateRequirementsService`.

8. **Save File Path**:
  - The `CandidateRequirementsService` sends the file path to the `ApplicationRepository` to save it.

9. **Confirm File Path Saved**:
  - The `ApplicationRepository` confirms the file path has been saved to the `CandidateRequirementsService`.

10. **Return Storage Confirmation**:
  - The `CandidateRequirementsService` returns the confirmation of file path storage to the `UploadCandidateRequirementsController`.

11. **Confirm Upload Success**:
  - The `UploadCandidateRequirementsController` confirms the upload success to the `UploadCandidateRequirementsUI`.

12. **Display Upload Success**:
  - The `UploadCandidateRequirementsUI` displays the upload success message to the `Operator`.

These interaction steps align with the system sequence diagram (SSD) provided and describe how the upload process should be handled by the various components of the system.
