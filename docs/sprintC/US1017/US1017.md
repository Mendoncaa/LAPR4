# US1017 - Upload Candidate Interview Answers


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to upload a text file with the candidate responses for an interview.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
    - The system must allow the Customer Manager to upload a text file with the candidate's responses for an interview.
    - The text file must be validated against the defined grammar to ensure it follows the expected format.
    - If the file format is invalid, the system must reject the upload and request a valid file from the user.
    - If the file is in the correct format, its content must be imported into the system for later use (e.g., in US1018).
    - The file must be stored securely, ideally integrated into the database, or, if not possible, in a secure server directory.

- **Clarifications**:
    - Validation errors, such as numeric answers filled with letters, should be considered format errors and lead to file rejection in US1017.
    - Syntax must be verified at the time of upload. If everything is correct, the file should be "imported" into the system for later use.
    - The imported file must be stored securely, preferably in the database, or in a secure server directory if the database is not feasible.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
    - The Customer Manager can upload a text file with the candidate's interview responses.
    - The system verifies the file format according to the defined grammar.
    - The system rejects files that are not in the correct format and provides feedback to the user.
    - The system imports the content of the valid file into the system for later use.
    - The imported file is stored securely, preferably in the database.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
    - The defined grammar to validate the file format.
    - The template for the answers should be generated to the Customer Manager.
### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
    - Text file with the candidate's interview responses.

- **Output Data**:
    - Confirmation that the file was successfully uploaded and imported.

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)
![SSD.svg](01.requirements-engineering%2Fsvg%2FSSD.svg)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the interaction between the Customer Manager and the system when uploading a candidate's interview answers file.
- The sequence should start with the Customer Manager's request and end with the system's confirmation.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- **Remarks**:
  [N/A]    

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

![US1017-DM](02.analysis/svg/DM.svg)

#### Description

- The domain model illustrates the `Application` aggregate and its relationship with `Candidate`, `JobOpening`, and `File`.
- Each `Application` can have multiple associated `Files`, which represent the candidate's requirements and interview answers.
- The `Application` aggregate includes an `ApplicationState`, which tracks the status of the application. The state can be `SUBMITTED`, `IN_REVIEW`, `ACCEPTED`, or `REJECTED`.
- The `File` entity includes attributes for the file path, file type (such as Candidate Requirements or Interview Answers), and its content.
- The `Candidate` aggregate represents the individual applying for the job and includes attributes such as email, name, and phone number.
- The `JobOpening` aggregate represents the job the candidate is applying for and includes details like job reference, number of vacancies, job title, contract type, and description.

**Domain Model Changes**:
- The `Application` entity is associated with `File` entities that hold the candidate's requirements and interview answers. These files are validated for syntax and stored for later evaluation.
- The `Validator` component ensures the uploaded files comply with the defined grammar and syntax.
- The `FileRepository` component handles the storage and retrieval of these files.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

- **Remarks**:
  - Ensure that the `Application` entity is correctly associated with the uploaded files and that these files are validated and stored efficiently.
  - Any errors in the file syntax should be reported back to the Costum Manager  for correction and re-upload.


## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer                                  | Justification (with patterns)                                                       |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1         | Request to upload candidate Interviews file | `UploadCandidateInterviewsUI`          | **Pure Fabrication**:                                                               |
| Step 2         | Requesting candidate Interviews file       | `UploadCandidateInterviewsUI`          | **Pure Fabrication**:                                                               |
| Step 3         | Uploading candidate Interviews file        | `UploadCandidateInterviewsController`  | **Controller**: The controller coordinates the upload request to the service layer. |
| Step 4         | Validating syntax of the file                | `InterviewsEvaluator`                  | **Service**: The service validates the syntax of the provided file using ANTLR.     |
| Step 5         | Saving the file path                         | `ApplicationRepository`                  | The repository persists the file path in the database.                              |
| Step 6         | Confirming the upload success                | `UploadCandidateInterviewsController`  | Controller: The controller receives the confirmation and informs the UI.            |
| Step 7         | Displaying confirmation to the user          | `UploadCandidateInterviewsUI`          | The UI component displays the success message to the operator.                      |

#### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: [N/A]

Other software classes (i.e., Pure Fabrication) identified:

- `UploadCandidateInterviewsUI`: The user interface component that allows the Operator to upload candidate Interviews files.
- `UploadCandidateInterviewsController`: Coordinates the interaction between the UI, domain model, and service layer. .
- `ApplicationRepository`: Persists the file path and associated application details in the database.
- `InterviewsEvaluator`: Validates the syntax of the provided file using ANTLR.

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)



![USXXX-SD](03.design/svg/SD.svg)

#### Interaction Steps

1. **Request to Upload File**:
  - The `Operator` requests to upload a candidate Interviews file using the `UploadCandidateInterviewsUI`.

2. **Request Candidate Interviews File**:
  - The `UploadCandidateInterviewsUI` requests the candidate Interviews file from the `Operator`.

3. **Provide Candidate Interviews File**:
  - The `Operator` provides the candidate Interviews file to the `UploadCandidateInterviewsUI`.

4. **Submit File Path**:
  - The `UploadCandidateInterviewsUI` submits the file path to the `UploadCandidateInterviewsController`.

5. **Validate File Syntax**:
  - The `UploadCandidateInterviewsController` sends the file to the `InterviewsEvaluator` to validate its syntax.

6. **Return Validation Result**:
  - The `InterviewsEvaluator` returns the validation result (valid or invalid) to the `UploadCandidateInterviewsController`.

7. **Store File Path**:
  - If the file is valid, the `UploadCandidateInterviewsController` sends a request to store the file path to the `CandidateInterviewsService`.

8. **Save File Path**:
  - The `CandidateInterviewsService` sends the file path to the `ApplicationRepository` to save it.

9. **Confirm File Path Saved**:
  - The `ApplicationRepository` confirms the file path has been saved to the `CandidateInterviewsService`.

10. **Return Storage Confirmation**:
  - The `CandidateInterviewsService` returns the confirmation of file path storage to the `UploadCandidateInterviewsController`.

11. **Confirm Upload Success**:
  - The `UploadCandidateInterviewsController` confirms the upload success to the `UploadCandidateInterviewsUI`.

12. **Display Upload Success**:
  - The `UploadCandidateInterviewsUI` displays the upload success message to the `Operator`.

These interaction steps align with the system sequence diagram (SSD) provided and describe how the upload process should be handled by the various components of the system.
