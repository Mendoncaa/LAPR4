# US1015 - Execute Verification Process for Job Opening Applications

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to execute the process of verification of requirements of applications for a job opening to ensure that all candidates meet the necessary criteria before proceeding to the next phase.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
    - The system must allow the Customer Manager to execute a verification process that checks if candidates meet the predefined requirements[Requirement Specification] for a job opening.
    - The verification process should validate the answers submitted by candidates against the requirements specified by the customer.
    - The system should provide a clear indication of which candidates are accepted or rejected based on the verification results.
    - The results of the verification process should be stored in the system.

- **Clarifications**:
    - The Customer Manager is responsible for initiating the verification process once the candidate's requirements files are uploaded and registered in the system.
    - The process will check each candidate's file against the job requirements and mark them as "Accepted" or "Rejected".
    - The verification process must be executed for all candidates who have submitted their requirements files.
    - The verification results are used to update the status of candidates, which can then be used to notify them of their application status through the subsequent user story (US1016).

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
    - The Customer Manager can successfully execute the verification process for a job opening.
    - The system accurately validates candidate files against the specified job requirements.
    - Candidates are marked as "Accepted" or "Rejected" based on the verification results.
    - The system stores the verification results and updates the status of each candidate.
    - The verification process can handle files being uploaded progressively and verify them as they come in.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
    - Job openings must have a Requirement Specification assigned (US1009)
    - Candidate´s Requirements   must be uploaded and registered by the Operator (US2003 and US2004).
  
### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
    - Job Reference
    - Candidate requirements files

- **Output Data**:
    - Verification results indicating whether each candidate is "Accepted" or "Rejected"
    - Updated candidate statuses in the system,

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

Claro, aqui está uma versão mais concisa do rationale, focando-se nos passos mais importantes da lógica das user stories:

### Interaction Rationale

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._
