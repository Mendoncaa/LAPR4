# US1015 - Execute Verification Process for Job Opening Applications

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to execute the process of verification of requirements of applications for a job opening to ensure that all candidates meet the necessary criteria before proceeding to the next phase.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
    - The system must allow the Customer Manager to execute a verification process that checks if candidates meet the predefined requirements for a job opening.
    - The verification process should validate the answers submitted by candidates against the requirements specified by the customer.
    - The system should provide a clear indication of which candidates are accepted or rejected based on the verification results.
    - The results of the verification process should be stored in the system for further analysis and reporting.

- **Clarifications**:
    - The Customer Manager is responsible for initiating the verification process once the candidate's requirements files are uploaded and registered in the system.
    - The process will check each candidate's file against the job requirements and mark them as "Accepted" or "Rejected".
    - The verification process must be executed for all candidates who have submitted their requirements files, but it can be done progressively as files are received.
    - The verification results are used to update the status of candidates, which can then be used to notify them of their application status through the subsequent user story (US1016).

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
    - The Customer Manager can successfully execute the verification process for a job opening.
    - The system accurately validates candidate files against the specified job requirements.
    - Candidates are marked as "Accepted" or "Rejected" based on the verification results.
    - The system stores the verification results and updates the status of each candidate.
    - The verification process can handle files being uploaded progressively and verify them as they come in.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
    - Job openings and their requirements must be registered in the system.
    - Candidate files must be uploaded and registered by the Operator (US2003 and US2004).
    - The system must have logic implemented to compare candidate responses against job requirements.
    - The Customer Manager must have the appropriate permissions to execute the verification process.
    - Support for notifying candidates of their application status based on the verification results (US1016).
    - Database support for persisting changes and retrieving candidate and job opening data.
    - Ensure user authentication and authorization to allow only the Customer Manager to execute the verification process.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
    - Job Reference
    - Candidate requirements files

- **Output Data**:
    - Verification results indicating whether each candidate is "Accepted" or "Rejected"
    - Updated candidate statuses in the system
    - Log of the verification process for auditing and reporting purposes
    - Validation messages if any issues are encountered during the verification process (e.g., missing or malformed files)

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer | Justification (with patterns) |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|:-------|:------------------------------|
| Step 1         |                                             |        |                               |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Class1
* Class2
* Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* xxxxUI
* xxxxController

# 4. Tests
_In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling._

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

_In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits._

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._


# 6. Integration and Demo

_In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system._


# 7. Observations

_In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work._
