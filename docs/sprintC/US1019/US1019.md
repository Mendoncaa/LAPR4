# US1019 - Get an Ordered List of Candidates Using Job Interview Points

---

## 1. Requirements Engineering

_In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identify the involved input and output data and depict an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement._

### 1.1. User Story Description

**As a** Customer Manager, **I want** to get an ordered list of candidates using the job interview points, **so that** I can analyze the candidates.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Q177:** For US1019, the ordered list should return candidates and their interview grades. An example was provided:
  ```
  Job Opening: XXX

  | Name     | Email          | Grade |
  |----------|----------------|-------|
  | Jane Doe | jane@doe.pt    | 85    |
  | John Doe | john@doe.pt    | 70    |
  ```

- **Q155:** The order of candidates should include at least all the first candidates within the vacancy number and some following candidates. A global configuration property in the system could determine this number.

- **Q160:** The Customer Manager can change the rank of a candidate after assigning it if none of the interested parties were yet notified of the results.

- **Q162:** All candidates should be ranked before moving to the result phase.

- **Q163:** The system should allow the Customer Manager to view interview scores and other relevant application information while ranking candidates.

- **Q165:** The Customer Manager must evaluate all candidates to produce a ranking/order for selecting the best candidates for the vacancies.

**Interpretation:** The system needs to provide a way to view and manage a list of candidates for a given job opening, ordered by their interview scores. The Customer Manager should be able to adjust the rankings before finalizing and notifying candidates.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must display a list of candidates for a selected job opening, ordered by their interview points.
2. The Customer Manager can change the ranking of candidates if results have not been notified.
3. The ranking process must include all candidates before finalizing.
4. The list should at least cover candidates within the vacancy number and a configurable number of additional candidates.
5. The Customer Manager should be able to see interview scores and other relevant application data while ranking candidates.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- Dependency on US1015: Verification of the interview process and its results.
- Dependency on US1013: Rank candidates.

### 1.5. Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**
- Job Opening ID (selected from a list)
- Candidate rankings (typed data, adjustable by the Customer Manager)

**Output Data:**
- Ordered list of candidates with their interview points and other relevant information.


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

Customer Manager should have 2 or more instances of the application running, so that he/she could, for instance, see the interviews grades and, at the same time, register the order/ranking of the candidates.



## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt


![US1019-DM](02.analysis/svg/DM.svg)

### 2.2. Other Remarks

The phase of the Job Opening should be in "Analysis" phase to guarantee that all the interviews were done and all the candidates were evaluated by the interviews.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer | Justification (with patterns) |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|:-------|:------------------------------|

| Step 10        |                                             |        |                               |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Class1
* Class2
* Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* xxxxUI
* xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view representing the sequence of interactions between software objects that allows to fulfill the requirements._

![USXXX-SD](03.design/svg/SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirements as well as their relations, attributes and methods._

# 4. Tests
_In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling._

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

_In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits._

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._


# 6. Integration and Demo

_In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system._


# 7. Observations

_In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work._
