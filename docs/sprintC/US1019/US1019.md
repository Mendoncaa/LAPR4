# US1019 - List Ordered Candidates by Interview Grades

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to get an ordered list of candidates, using the job interview points (grades), to help me analyze the candidates.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
  - The system must allow the Customer Manager to view a list of candidates for a specific job opening, ordered by their interview grades in descending order.
  - The list should include each candidate's name, email, and interview grade.
  - Only job openings that include an interview should be considered.

- **Clarifications**:
  - The ordered list is specifically related to a job opening.
  - The ordering is descending, from the highest grade to the lowest grade.
  - The goal is to provide the Customer Manager with a way to easily review and compare candidates based on their interview performance.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
  - The Customer Manager can successfully retrieve an ordered list of candidates based on their interview grades.
  - The list should display candidates' names, emails, and grades in descending order of the grades.
  - The system should only allow this functionality for job openings that include an interview phase.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
  - Job openings must be registered and have an interview phase completed.
  - The system must store interview grades.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
  - Job Reference

- **Output Data**:
  - Ordered list of candidates including their names, emails, and interview grades


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

**Description**:
- The SSD illustrates the interaction between the Customer Manager and the system when requesting an ordered list of candidates by interview grades.
- The sequence starts with the Customer Manager's request and ends with the system displaying the ordered list of candidates with their grades.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt


![US1019-DM](02.analysis/svg/DM.svg)


### 2.2. Explanation

* The `Job Opening` class represents the job opening for which the candidates are applying. It is linked to the JobReference class, which holds the unique identifier for the job opening, and the RecruitmentProcess class, which represents the recruitment process associated with the job opening.

* The `RecruitmentProcess` class has a list of Phase objects, representing the different phases of the recruitment process. Each Phase has a PhaseName and PhaseStatus, which can be used to check if the job opening is in the "Analysis" phase, as required by the user story.

* The `Application class` represents the applications submitted by the candidates for the job opening. It is linked to the JobOpening class and the Candidate class. It also has an Interview object, which represents the interview associated with the application.

* The `Interview` class has an InterviewGrade object, which represents the grade obtained by the candidate in the interview. This grade is used to order the candidates, as required by the user story.

* The `Candidate` class represents the candidates applying for the job opening. It has CandidateEmail and CandidateName objects, which represent the email and name of the candidate, respectively. These details are included in the ordered list of candidates, as required by the user story.

### 2.3. Other remarks

- **Remarks**:
  - The system should only allow this functionality for job openings that are in the "Analysis" phase. This can be checked by verifying the status of the "Analysis" phase in the RecruitmentProcess associated with the job opening.

#### Detailed Explanation:

Here is a detailed explanation of the rationale, focused on the user story logic and business rules:


**Initiate the request to order applications**: The actor (Customer Manager) initiates the process of ordering applications through the user interface (ListOrderedApplicationUI). This action is justified by the Pure Fabrication pattern, as the user interface does not represent a domain concept, but is necessary to interact with the actor.  
Ask for Job Reference: The user interface (ListOrderedApplicationUI) interacts directly with the actor to obtain the job reference. This action is justified by the Pure Fabrication pattern, as the user interface does not represent a domain concept, but is necessary to interact with the actor.  

**Validate Job Reference**: The controller (ListOrderedApplicationController) coordinates the validation logic for the job reference. This action is justified by the Controller pattern, as the controller is responsible for coordinating the validation logic.  

**Validate Current Phase of Recruitment Process**: The service (OrderApplicationService) is responsible for validating the current phase of the recruitment process. This action is justified by the Information Expert pattern, as the service has the information needed to validate the current phase. This step ensures that all interviews were done and all candidates were evaluated by the interviews before the applications can be ordered.


**Order Applications**: The service (OrderApplicationService) is responsible for ordering the applications. This action is justified by the Service pattern, as the service encapsulates the business logic related to ordering the applications.  

**Show Ordered List of Candidates**: The user interface (ListOrderedApplicationUI) is responsible for displaying the ordered list to the actor. This action is justified by the Pure Fabrication pattern, as the user interface does not represent a domain concept, but is necessary to interact with the actor.
