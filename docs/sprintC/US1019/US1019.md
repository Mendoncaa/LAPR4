# US1019 - Get an Ordered List of Candidates Using Job Interview Points

---

## 1. Requirements Engineering

_In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identify the involved input and output data and depict an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement._

### 1.1. User Story Description

**As a** Customer Manager, **I want** to get an ordered list of candidates using the job interview points, **so that** I can analyze the candidates.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Q177:** For US1019, the ordered list should return candidates and their interview grades. An example was provided:
  ```
  Job Opening: XXX

  | Name     | Email          | Grade |
  |----------|----------------|-------|
  | Jane Doe | jane@doe.pt    | 85    |
  | John Doe | john@doe.pt    | 70    |
  ```

- **Q155:** The order of candidates should include at least all the first candidates within the vacancy number and some following candidates. A global configuration property in the system could determine this number.

- **Q160:** The Customer Manager can change the rank of a candidate after assigning it if none of the interested parties were yet notified of the results.

- **Q162:** All candidates should be ranked before moving to the result phase.

- **Q163:** The system should allow the Customer Manager to view interview scores and other relevant application information while ranking candidates.

- **Q165:** The Customer Manager must evaluate all candidates to produce a ranking/order for selecting the best candidates for the vacancies.

**Interpretation:** The system needs to provide a way to view and manage a list of candidates for a given job opening, ordered by their interview scores. The Customer Manager should be able to adjust the rankings before finalizing and notifying candidates.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must display a list of candidates for a selected job opening, ordered by their interview points.
2. The Customer Manager can change the ranking of candidates if results have not been notified.
3. The ranking process must include all candidates before finalizing.
4. The list should at least cover candidates within the vacancy number and a configurable number of additional candidates.
5. The Customer Manager should be able to see interview scores and other relevant application data while ranking candidates.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- Dependency on US1015: Verification of the interview process and its results.
- Dependency on US1013: Rank candidates.

### 1.5. Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**
- Job Opening ID (selected from a list)
- Candidate rankings (typed data, adjustable by the Customer Manager)

**Output Data:**
- Ordered list of candidates with their interview points and other relevant information.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

Customer Manager should have 2 or more instances of the application running, so that he/she could, for instance, see the interviews grades and, at the same time, register the order/ranking of the candidates.



## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt


![US1019-DM](02.analysis/svg/DM.svg)

### 2.2. Other Remarks

The phase of the Job Opening should be in "Analysis" phase to guarantee that all the interviews were done and all the candidates were evaluated by the interviews.

#### Detailed Explanation:

1. **ListOrderedApplicationUI**:
  - **Why?**: It interacts directly with the `CustomerManager` to get the job reference and show the ordered list of candidates.
  - **Pattern**: **Pure Fabrication**: It is created solely for handling the user interface interactions, without involving any business logic.

2. **ListOrderedApplicationController**:
  - **Why?**: It coordinates the entire use case, from receiving the job reference to fetching and ordering applications.
  - **Pattern**: **Controller**: It handles the user input and orchestrates calls to other components to fulfill the request.

3. **PersistenceContext**:
  - **Why?**: It manages access to repositories, ensuring that the right repository instances are created and used.
  - **Pattern**: **Pure Fabrication**: It simplifies access to repositories and maintains separation of concerns.

4. **JobOpeningRepository**:
  - **Why?**: It retrieves job openings based on the job reference.
  - **Pattern**: DataBase

5. **OrderApplicationService**:
  - **Why?**: It contains the business logic for ordering applications by their interview grades and validating the current phase of the JobOpening.
  - **Pattern**: Service

6. **ApplicationRepository**:
  - **Why?**: It retrieves all applications associated with a job opening.
  - **Pattern**: DataBase

This rationale ensures that the system follows the GRASP principles, maintaining a clear separation of concerns, and assigning responsibilities to the most appropriate classes based on their roles and expertise.
