# US2004 - Upload a Text File with Candidate Data Fields for Verification

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an Operator, I want to upload a text file with the data fields (requirements) of a candidate for its verification.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
    - The system must allow the Operator to upload a text file containing the data fields of a candidate.
    - The operator has access to all the files submitted by the candidates, can than consult these files in order to answer the questions in the requirements template file then submits the file with the answers


- **Clarifications**:
    - The file format should be standardized (e.g., CSV, TXT) to ensure consistency.
    - If any issues are encountered during verification, validation messages should be displayed to the Operator.

### Recruitment Process Phases

| Phase        | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application  | Candidates submit their applications.                                                                            |
| Screening    | Applications are verified against a set of requirements. Applications not meeting the requirements are rejected. |
| Interviews   | (Optional) Accepted candidates may be interviewed. Results are recorded for further analysis.                    |
| Analysis     | Applications are analyzed using all available information. Candidates are ranked based on this analysis.         |
| Result       | Candidates and customers are notified of the final results.                                                      |

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
    - The Operator can successfully upload a text file with candidate data fields.
    - Validation messages should be displayed if any issues are encountered during the verification process.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
    - The job opening and its recruitment process must be registered in the system.
    - The file format and structure must be predefined.
    - In US 2003, the Operator generates a template file with the data to be entered to validate an application. In US 2004, the Operator, after filling in the specific data of the application (based on the previous template file) submits this file to the system that will be used for the system to evaluate/verify the application.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
    - Text file with candidate data fields 

- **Output Data**:
    - List aplication
    - Upload Done Successfully.
  
### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)
![SSD.svg](01.requirements-engineering%2Fsvg%2FSSD.svg)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the interaction between the Operator and the system when uploading and verifying a text file.
- The sequence starts with the Operator's request to upload a file and ends with the system's confirmation.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- **Remarks**:
    - Ensure that all candidate data fields are verified before proceeding to the next phase of the recruitment process.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

![DM.svg](02.analysis%2Fsvg%2FDM.svg)

#### Description
- JobOpening refers to many Applications, indicating that a job opening can have multiple associated applications.
- Application refers to a Candidate, showing that each application is submitted by a candidate.
- Candidate refers to many Applications, showing that a candidate can submit multiple applications.
- JobOpening can refer to a RequirementsSpecification, indicating that a job opening can have a associated requirements specification.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer                          | Justification (with patterns)                                                                  |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1         | User asks to import candidate response      | `UploadRequirementsUI`         | The UI component handles the request from the user to import candidate response.               |
| Step 2         | Retrieving applications for selection       | `UploadRequirementsController` | The controller retrieves the list of applications to present to the user.                       |
| Step 3         | Retrieving all applications                 | `ApplicationService`           | The service class fetches all applications for processing.                                       |
| Step 4         | User selects an application                 | `UploadRequirementsUI`         | The UI component prompts the user to select an application.                                      |
| Step 5         | User uploads a text file with requirements  | `UploadRequirementsUI`         | The UI component handles the user's action of uploading a text file with requirements.           |
| Step 6         | Handling the uploaded file                  | `UploadRequirementsController` | The controller receives the uploaded file and the selected application for processing.          |
| Step 7         | Processing the uploaded file               | `UploadRequirementsController` | The controller coordinates the processing of the uploaded file and its association with the application. |
| Step 8         | Updating application responses             | `ApplicationService`           | The service class updates the application responses with the content of the uploaded file.       |
| Step 9         | Notifying the user of success               | `UploadRequirementsUI`         | The UI component informs the user about the successful update.                                   |
