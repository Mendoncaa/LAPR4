# US2004 - Upload a Text File with Candidate Data Fields for Verification

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an Operator, I want to upload a text file with the data fields (requirements) of a candidate for its verification.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
    - The system must allow the Operator to upload a text file containing the data fields of a candidate.
    - The system should parse and verify the contents of the file according to predefined criteria.
    - If the criteria are not met, the application is refused.
    - The operator has access to all the files submitted by the candidates, can than consult these files in order to answer the questions in the requirements template file then submits the file with the answers


- **Clarifications**:
    - The file format should be standardized (e.g., CSV, TXT) to ensure consistency.
    - Verification involves checking the data fields against predefined rules and criteria.
    - If any issues are encountered during verification, validation messages should be displayed to the Operator.

### Recruitment Process Phases

| Phase        | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application  | Candidates submit their applications.                                                                            |
| Screening    | Applications are verified against a set of requirements. Applications not meeting the requirements are rejected. |
| Interviews   | (Optional) Accepted candidates may be interviewed. Results are recorded for further analysis.                    |
| Analysis     | Applications are analyzed using all available information. Candidates are ranked based on this analysis.         |
| Result       | Candidates and customers are notified of the final results.                                                      |

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
    - The Operator can successfully upload a text file with candidate data fields.
    - The system should parse the file and verify the data fields according to predefined criteria.
    - Validation messages should be displayed if any issues are encountered during the verification process.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
    - The job opening and its recruitment process must be registered in the system.
    - The file format and structure must be predefined and standardized.
    - In US 2003, the Operator generates a template file with the data to be entered to validate an application. In US 2004, the Operator, after filling in the specific data of the application (based on the previous template file) submits this file to the system that will be used for the system to evaluate/verify the application.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
    - Text file with candidate data fields (e.g., CSV, TXT)

- **Output Data**:
    - Validation messages if any issues are encountered during the verification process (e.g., missing or malformed files)
    - Upload Done Successfully.
    - 
### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the interaction between the Operator and the system when uploading and verifying a text file.
- The sequence starts with the Operator's request to upload a file and ends with the system's confirmation.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- **Remarks**:
    - Ensure that all candidate data fields are verified before proceeding to the next phase of the recruitment process.
