## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to execute the process that evaluates (grades) the interviews for a job opening.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
    - The system must allow the Customer Manager to grade the interviews conducted for a job opening.
    - Each interview must be evaluated based on predefined criteria.
    - The evaluation should be recorded and stored for each candidate.
    - After the evaluation process of all job opening interviews have been executed, they do not change phases.


- **Clarifications**:
    - Evaluating an interview involves assigning a grade based on several criteria.
    - The criteria for grading should be standardized across all candidates for consistency.

### Recruitment Process Phases

| Phase        | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application  | Candidates submit their applications.                                                                            |
| Screening    | Applications are verified against a set of requirements. Applications not meeting the requirements are rejected. |
| Interviews   | (Optional) Accepted candidates may be interviewed. Results are recorded for further analysis.                    |
| Analysis     | Applications are analyzed using all available information. Candidates are ranked based on this analysis.         |
| Result       | Candidates and customers are notified of the final results.                                                      |

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
    - The Customer Manager can successfully record grades for each interview.
    - The system should store the grades and allow for their retrieval in the analysis phase.
    - All interviews must be graded before moving to the next phase (it just runs in another US).

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
    - The job opening and its recruitment process must be registered in the system.
    - Interviews must be scheduled and conducted before they can be graded.
    - Criteria for grading must be predefined and standardized.
    - Ensure user authentication and authorization to allow only the Customer Manager to grade interviews.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
  - Job Reference
  - Candidate interviews files

- **Output Data**:
  - Verification results indicating a rating note for each candidate
  - Log of the verification process for auditing and reporting purposes
  - Validation messages if any issues are encountered during the verification process (e.g., missing or malformed files)
