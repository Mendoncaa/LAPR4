# US1018 - Execute the Process that Evaluates (Grades) the Interviews for a Job Opening

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to execute the process that evaluates (grades) the interviews for a job opening.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
    - The system must allow the Customer Manager to grade the interviews conducted for a job opening.
    - Each interview must be evaluated based on predefined criteria.
    - The evaluation should be recorded and stored for each candidate.
    - After the evaluation process of all job opening interviews have been executed, they do not change phases.


- **Clarifications**:
    - Evaluating an interview involves assigning a grade based on several criteria.
    - The criteria for grading should be standardized across all candidates for consistency.

### Recruitment Process Phases

| Phase        | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application  | Candidates submit their applications.                                                                            |
| Screening    | Applications are verified against a set of requirements. Applications not meeting the requirements are rejected. |
| Interviews   | (Optional) Accepted candidates may be interviewed. Results are recorded for further analysis.                    |
| Analysis     | Applications are analyzed using all available information. Candidates are ranked based on this analysis.         |
| Result       | Candidates and customers are notified of the final results.                                                      |

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
    - The Customer Manager can successfully record grades for each interview.
    - The system should store the grades and allow for their retrieval in the analysis phase.
    - All interviews must be graded before moving to the next phase (it just runs in another US).

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
    - The job opening and its recruitment process must be registered in the system.
    - Interviews must be scheduled and conducted before they can be graded.
    - Criteria for grading must be predefined and standardized.
    - Ensure user authentication and authorization to allow only the Customer Manager to grade interviews.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
  - Job Reference
  - Candidate interviews files

- **Output Data**:
  - Verification results indicating a rating note for each candidate
  - Log of the verification process for auditing and reporting purposes
  - Validation messages if any issues are encountered during the verification process (e.g., missing or malformed files)

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)
![SSD.svg](01.requirements-engineering%2Fsvg%2FSSD.svg)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the interaction between the Customer Manager and the system when grading interviews.
- The sequence starts with the Customer Manager's request to grade an interview and ends with the system's confirmation of the grades recorded.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- **Remarks**:
    - Ensure that all interviews are graded before the analysis phase.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt
![excertodm-Domain_Driven_Design.png](03.design%2Fsvg%2Fexcertodm-Domain_Driven_Design.png)

#### Description

### JobOpeningAgg
- **JobOpening**: This is the central entity that represents a job opening.
- **JobReference**: A unique identifier for the job opening
- **RecruitmentProcess**: This entity includes various `Phases` of the recruitment, such as application review, interview, and final decision, each with a `PhaseName`, `StartDate`, `EndDate`, and `Status`.

### ApplicationAgg
- **Application**: Represents an application submitted by a candidate for a job opening.
- **ApplicationState**: Tracks the current status of the application.
- **Interview**: Contains information about the candidate's interview, including `InterviewDateTime` and optional `InterviewGrade`.
- **File**: Represents files associated with the application, such as resumes or interview recordings, identified by a `FilePath` and `FileType`.

### CandidateAgg
- **Candidate**: Represents a candidate applying for the job.

### InterviewModelAgg
- **InterviewModel**: Defines the structure and format of the interview, including `JarFile`, `SpecName`, and `Description`. This model is used to standardize the evaluation criteria for the interviews.

### Key Relationships
- **JobOpening to RequirementsSpecification**: Each job opening may have an associated requirements specification, defining the job requirements.
- **JobOpening to InterviewModel**: Each job opening may have an associated interview model, defining how interviews should be conducted and evaluated.
- **Application to JobOpening**: Each application refers to a specific job opening.
