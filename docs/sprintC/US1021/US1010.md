# US1021 - Display All Data of an Application

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to display all the data of an application.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
  - The system must allow the Customer Manager to view all the data associated with a candidate's application.
  - The data should be comprehensive and include all relevant information submitted by the candidate.
  - The displayed data should be organized and easily accessible for review.

- **Clarifications**:
  - Viewing the data involves displaying the entire application, including personal details, qualifications, experience, and any other relevant documents.
  - The data presentation should ensure no information is omitted and it should be easy to navigate.

### Recruitment Process Phases

| Phase        | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application  | Candidates submit their applications.                                                                            |
| Screening    | Applications are verified against a set of requirements. Applications not meeting the requirements are rejected. |
| Interviews   | (Optional) Accepted candidates may be interviewed. Results are recorded for further analysis.                    |
| Analysis     | Applications are analyzed using all available information. Candidates are ranked based on this analysis.         |
| Result       | Candidates and customers are notified of the final results.                                                      |

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
  - The Customer Manager can successfully view all data of an application.
  - The system should retrieve and display all relevant information for a candidate's application.
  - The displayed data should be accurate and complete.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
  - The job opening and its recruitment process must be registered in the system.
  - Applications must be submitted and stored in the system before they can be viewed.
  - List the applications.
  - Ensure user authentication and authorization to allow only the Customer Manager to view application data.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
  - Select Application 

- **Output Data**:
  - Display of the complete application data for a candidate
  - Display applications
  - Validation messages if any issues are encountered during data retrieval (e.g., missing data)

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the interaction between the Customer Manager and the system when displaying application data.
- The sequence starts with the Customer Manager's request to view an application and ends with the system's presentation of the data.


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

[DM.puml](02.analysis%2Fpuml%2FDM.puml)

#### Description

### JobOpeningAgg
- **JobOpening**: This is the central entity that represents a job opening.
- **JobReference**: A unique identifier for the job opening
- **RecruitmentProcess**: This entity includes various `Phases` of the recruitment, such as application review, interview, and final decision, each with a `PhaseName`, `StartDate`, `EndDate`, and `Status`.

### ApplicationAgg
- **Application**: Represents an application submitted by a candidate for a job opening.
- **ApplicationState**: Tracks the current status of the application.
- **Interview**: Contains information about the candidate's interview, including `InterviewDateTime` and optional `InterviewGrade`.
- **File**: Represents files associated with the application, such as resumes or interview recordings, identified by a `FilePath` and `FileType`.

### CandidateAgg
- **Candidate**: Represents a candidate applying for the job.

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer | Justification (with patterns) |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------|:-------|:------------------------------|
| Step 1         | Requesting the display of all data of an application | User | The User initiates the request to display all data of an application. |
| Step 2         | Performing the operation of displaying all data of an application | UI | The UI is responsible for handling user interactions and displaying information. |
| Step 3         | Initiating the operation to display all data of an application | UI | The UI triggers the operation to display all data of an application in response to the user's request. |
| Step 4         | Processing the request to display all data of an application | Controller | The Controller receives the request from the UI and processes it. |
| Step 5         | Retrieving all applications | Controller | The Controller retrieves all applications from the ApplicationRepository. |
| Step 6         | Accessing the data of all applications | Repository | The Repository is responsible for accessing and retrieving data from the data store (ApplicationRepository). |
| Step 7         | Returning the list of applications | Repository | The Repository returns the list of applications to the Controller. |
| Step 8         | Presenting the list of applications | Controller | The Controller presents the list of applications to the UI. |
