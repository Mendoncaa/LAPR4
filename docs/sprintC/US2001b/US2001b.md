# US2001b - Process Email Bot Files

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

_As an Operator, I want the system to process the files produced by the Applications Email Bot, so that they can be imported into the system by the initiative of the Operator._

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- The email bot is outside the scope of the system, but the files it produces need to be processed by the system.
- Files include data on job applications which must be imported automatically.
- The operator initiates the process, ensuring no manual data entry from emails.
- The system must recognize file formats (e.g., CV, email, candidate data).

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- Files are processed and imported correctly without manual intervention.
- The system identifies and logs errors during import.
- Imported data is correctly reflected in the system.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- Dependencies on the correct functioning of the Email Bot.
- The shared folder where the Email Bot deposits files must be accessible.
- System must handle potential duplicate files appropriately.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

- Files must be retained in the shared folder until processed.
- System should maintain a consistent state and handle restarts gracefully.
- The operator must be able to manually intervene in case of errors.

## 6. Integration and Demo

The integration involves ensuring that the functionality of processing email bot files works seamlessly with the existing system. This includes:

- The file import process initiated by the operator.
- Automated processing of files into the system database.

## 7. Observations

This functionality is critical for automating the job application process. A potential issue could be the coordination between different teams handling the email bot and the system processing these files. Ensuring clear communication and defined responsibilities will be crucial to avoid misunderstandings and delays. Future improvements might include enhancing the bot's capabilities or refining error handling.
