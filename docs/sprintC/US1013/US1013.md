# US1013 - Rank the Candidates for a Job Opening

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to rank the candidates for a job opening.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- **Customer Specification**:
  - The system must allow the Customer Manager to rank candidates for a job opening.
  - The fact that there are no interviews has no bearing on the ranking of candidates, as this does not explicitly depend on interviews. (Job Opening could not have interviews as a requirement).
  - The ranking should be recorded and stored for each candidate.
  - After ranking all candidates, the information should be available for the next phase (Results).

- **Clarifications**:
  - Ranking candidates involves assigning a position in a ranked list based on several criteria.
  - The Customer Manager is responsible for analyzing applications and deciding the ranking of candidates.
  - The Customer Manager performs the ranking during the analysis phase using all available information, including CVs and interview results if applicable.
  - The ranking process should allow the Customer Manager to stop and continue later if needed.
  - The Customer Manager can change the rank of a candidate if none of the interested parties were yet notified of the results.

### Recruitment Process Phases

| Phase        | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Analysis     | Applications are analyzed using all available information. Candidates are ranked based on this analysis.         |

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **Criteria**:
  - All candidates must be ranked before moving to the next phase (it just runs in another US).
  - Ranking is not automatic and requires the Customer Manager to manually assign positions to candidates.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- **Dependencies**:
  - Register an application of a candidate for a job opening
  - Ensure user authentication and authorization to allow only the Customer Manager to rank candidates.
  - Candidates must have completed the previous phases before they can be ranked.
  - Execute the process of verification of requirements of applications for a job opening.


### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- **Input Data**:
  - Option to select a job opening
  - Ranks the candidate

- **Output Data**:
  - List of job openings
  - List of candidates
  - Confirmation or error message

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

**Description**:
- The SSD shows the sequence of interactions between the Customer Manager and the system to rank the candidates for a job opening.
- The Customer Manager selects a job opening and ranks the candidates.

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

![US013-DM](02.analysis/svg/DomainModel.svg)

#### Description
- The domain model illustrates the `JobOpening` aggregate and its relationship with phases of the recruitment process, ranks, and candidates.
- Each `JobOpening` can have multiple phases, and these phases must follow a strict sequential order as defined in the recruitment process.
- The `JobOpening` aggregate includes a `RecruitmentProcess`, which tracks the status of the overall process. The status can be uninitiated, in process, or finished, reflecting the overall progression of the job opening phases.
- Each `Phase` within the `RecruitmentProcess` is defined by its name, start date, end date, and status (open or closed).
- The model includes a `Rank` aggregate. Each `Rank` is associated with a `JobOpening` and has a unique identifier, rank position and rank status. Ranks are assigned to job openings and are evaluated by candidates.
- Additionally, the model includes a `Candidate` aggregate. Each `Candidate` is associated with an email address, and candidates are ranked through the RankPosition.
- The `RankPosition` class represents the ranking position assigned to a candidate.
- The model includes a `Candidate` aggregate. Each `Candidate` is associated with an email address, and candidates are ranked through the `RankPosition`.


**Domain Model Changes**:
- The `Rank` aggregate now includes `rankStatus` to reflect the state of the ranking process (unstarted, started, finished).
- `RankPosition` directly links a candidate to their respective rank value.
- This change ensures that each candidateâ€™s ranking status and position are clearly represented and managed within the system.
### 2.2. Other Remarks

- **Remarks**:
  - Ensure that phase objects within a `JobOpening` are manipulated correctly to reflect their status transitions.
  - Any changes to the phases should be immediately reflected in the system's state and visible to relevant actors (Customer Manager and potentially Admin).
  - Ensure that the phase transitions are managed without overlaps. Each phase must be closed before the next one can be opened.
  - Ensure that `RankPosition` correctly links to `Candidate` and reflects accurate ranking.

# 4. Tests

## Unit Tests

> **NOTE:** There were no Unit tests made for this user story due to the simplicity of the feature. The ranking process is a manual task performed by the Customer Manager, and the system does not automate the ranking process. The ranking process is straightforward and intuitive, requiring the Customer Manager to assign positions to candidates based on the analysis of available information. The system provides feedback to the Customer Manager if any issues are encountered during the ranking process. The ranking process is secure and ensures that only authorized users can access and modify the rankings.
