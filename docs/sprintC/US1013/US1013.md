# US1013 - Rank the Candidates for a Job Opening

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to rank the candidates for a job opening.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- Customer Specification:
  - The system must allow the Customer Manager to rank candidates for a job opening.
  - The fact that there are no interviews has no bearing on the ranking of candidates, as this does not explicitly depend on interviews.
  - The ranking should be recorded and stored for each candidate.
  - After ranking all candidates, the rankings should be available for analysis in the subsequent phases.

- Clarifications:
  - Ranking candidates involves assigning a position in a ranked list based on several criteria.
  - The Customer Manager is responsible for analyzing applications and deciding the ranking of candidates.
  - The Customer Manager performs the ranking during the analysis phase using all available information, including CVs and interview results if applicable.
  - The ranking process should allow the Customer Manager to stop and continue later if needed.
  - The Customer Manager can change the rank of a candidate if none of the interested parties were yet notified of the results.
