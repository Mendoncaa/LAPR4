# US1013 - Rank the Candidates for a Job Opening

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Customer Manager, I want to rank the candidates for a job opening.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

- *Customer Specification*:
    - The system must allow the Customer Manager to rank candidates for a job opening.
    - The fact that there are no interviews has no bearing on the ranking of candidates, as this does not explicitly depend on interviews.
    - The ranking should be recorded and stored for each candidate.
    - After ranking all candidates, the rankings should be available for analysis in the subsequent phases.

- *Clarifications*:
    - Ranking candidates involves assigning a position in a ranked list based on several criteria.
    - The criteria for ranking should be standardized across all candidates for consistency.

### Recruitment Process Phases

| Phase        | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application  | Candidates submit their applications.                                                                            |
| Screening    | Applications are verified against a set of requirements. Applications not meeting the requirements are rejected. |
| Interviews   | (Optional) Accepted candidates may be interviewed. Results are recorded for further analysis.                    |
| Analysis     | Applications are analyzed using all available information. Candidates are ranked based on this analysis.         |
| Result       | Candidates and customers are notified of the final results.                                                      |

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- *Criteria*:
    - All candidates must be ranked before moving to the next phase (it just runs in another US).
    - Ranking is not automatic
    - There is no note or scale to use. Applications are ordered.

### 1.4. Identified Dependencies

- *Dependencies*:
  -  Register an application of a candidate for a job opening
  - Candidates must have completed the previous phases before they can be ranked.
  - Ensure user authentication and authorization to allow only the Customer Manager to rank candidates.
  -  Execute the process of verification of requirements of applications for a job opening.
